## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Secure FinTech Mini-App** built using **Streamlit** as part of the CY4053 course.  
It demonstrates the application of **secure coding principles**, **encryption**, **input sanitization**, and **secure user authentication** practices in financial web applications.

The app ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access through **cryptographic encryption** and **role-based access flow**.

  - Each wallet can have multiple transactions (ID + numeric value)
  - Data stored in encrypted form
- **Secure File Upload**
  - Validates allowed file types (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .pdf, .csv, .txt)
  - Rejects malicious uploads
- **Encryption/Decryption Tool**
  - Allows users to encrypt/decrypt custom text securely
- **Audit Logs**
  - Tracks all key user actions (login, logout, wallet creation, etc.)
  - Downloadable in Excel format

## 🧪 Manual Testing Overview

Manual security tests were performed according to the provided assignment document.  
Each test case verifies one of the implemented security features.

| Test Case | Example Scenario | Expected Result |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| SQL Injection | `' OR 1=1--` in login field | Unsafe input blocked |
| Input Sanitization | `<script>alert()</script>` | Removed safely |
| Account Lockout | 5 wrong passwords | Login blocked for 60s |
| Encrypted Record Check | Viewed raw DB | Data unreadable (ciphertext) |
| Secure Error Handling | Forced divide-by-zero | Safe handled message |
| Unauthorized Access | Access wallet without login | Denied |
| File Upload | Upload `.exe` | Blocked |
